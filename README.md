# 3D Robotic Arm Design

This project contains a 3D model of a robotic arm created using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tinkercad**: For 3D modeling
- **STL Format**: For 3D printing and editing in other 3D software

## 📁 Files
- `Robot arm 3D.stl`: Main robotic arm model
- `screenshot.png`: Preview image of the design

## 🤖 Arm Components
- Rotating base
- 3 articulated joints
- Gripper at the end
- Degrees of Freedom: 5 DOF

## 📦 Usage
1. Download the `Robot arm 3D.stl` file.
2. Open it in a 3D modeling or slicing software (e.g., Fusion 360, Cura, Blender).
3. Modify or 3D print as needed.
